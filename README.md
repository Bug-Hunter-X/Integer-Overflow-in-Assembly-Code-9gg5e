# Integer Overflow Bug in Assembly

This repository demonstrates a common error in assembly programming: integer overflow.  The `bug.asm` file contains code that is vulnerable to overflow. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides a corrected version. This example highlights the importance of careful consideration of data types and potential overflow situations when working with low-level languages like assembly. 

## Bug Description
The `bug.asm` code snippet attempts to add 0x10 to a value read from memory. However, it fails to check for potential integer overflow.  If the initial value at `[ebx+0x10]` plus 0x10 exceeds the maximum value for the `eax` register, an overflow occurs, leading to unexpected and potentially harmful results.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.asm` provides a more robust approach that checks for potential overflow before performing the addition. This helps prevent unexpected behavior and improves the overall reliability of the code.
